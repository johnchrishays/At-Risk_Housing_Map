###Mercy Housing Lakefront: Resource Development
###Aug. 17th, 2018

#Research Questions:
Where do Opportunity Zones and at-risk housing overlap? This housing might be two- to four-flats or large buildings. Anything larger than single-family.) Is there an opportunity for MHL to preserve low-income housing in gentrifying neighborhoods, particularly to serve re-entry populations? Are there low-income housing shortages in OZs?
* What publicly accessible indicators of at-risk housing conversions already exist? What are the key factors that indicate at-risk housing and/or gentrification?
* Are there important characteristics of re-entry population employment, education, health that should be considered? (I.e. Should we think about employment opportunities in the areas where MHL might consider developing?)
* Are there long-term vacancy rates and/or housing shortage indicators that might provide insight?
* Other indicators worth considering: # of bedrooms per apartment (for re-entry mothers) or avg square footage, access to resources like public transportation or IL Qualified Allocation Plan from IDA characteristics

#Data Availability:
##Housing stock composition:
* Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University
  * Scale: Chicago Community Areas (which roughly correspond to neighborhoods), Wards or larger scale
  * Timespan: just 2015
  * Data -- https://www.housingstudies.org/dataportal/composition/housing-units-composition/chicago-community-areas/2015/2015/ (seems to come from Assessor’s Office, although I don’t know how they did it)
  * Landing page -- https://www.housingstudies.org/research-publications/publications/composition-cook-countys-housing-market/  
* Opportunity Zones:
  * Enterprise Community
  * https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/opportunity360/opportunity-zone-eligibility-tool
* Policy Map (has opportunity areas among other things, came out of MHL)

##Gentrification:
* Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University
  * Includes property sales data, mortgage data, foreclosure filings data and vacancy data
  * Background + data -- https://www.housingstudies.org/page/ihs-data-projects/
* Partnership Organizations:
  * NowPow list of Chicago Service Providers

#Scope:
##Questions:
* What medium will convey this information best?
* Who is the target audience? What is the best case scenario for this?
* What geographic region will be most useful. Is it just Cook County, or also DuPage and Lake?
#Preliminary Findings / Guesses
##OZ/2- to 4- flat overlap:
* Neighborhoods containing OZs with the highest proportion of 2- to 4- flat housing
  * West: Humboldt Park (57%), West Garfield (65%), North Lawndale (57%)
  * South: Fuller Park (66%), New City (70%), Englewood/West Englewood (~50% but almost totally covered by OZ tracts)
