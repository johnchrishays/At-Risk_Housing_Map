###Mercy Housing Lakefront: Resource Development
###Aug. 17th, 2018

#Research Questions:
Where do low-income housing tax incentives and at-risk housing overlap? This housing might be two- to four-flats or large buildings. Anything larger than single-family.) Is there an opportunity for MHL to preserve low-income housing in gentrifying neighborhoods, particularly to serve re-entry populations? Are there low-income housing shortages in OZs?
* What publicly accessible indicators of at-risk housing conversions already exist? What are the key factors that indicate at-risk housing and/or gentrification?
* Are there important characteristics of re-entry population employment, education, health that should be considered? (I.e. Should we think about employment opportunities in the areas where MHL might consider developing?)
* Are there long-term vacancy rates and/or housing shortage indicators that might provide insight?
* Other indicators worth considering: # of bedrooms per apartment (for re-entry mothers) or avg square footage, access to resources like public transportation or IL Qualified Allocation Plan from IDA characteristics

#Data Availability:
##Housing stock composition:
* Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University
  * Scale: Chicago Community Areas (which roughly correspond to neighborhoods), Wards or larger scale
  * Timespan: just 2015
  * Data -- https://www.housingstudies.org/dataportal/composition/housing-units-composition/chicago-community-areas/2015/2015/ (seems to come from Assessor’s Office, although I don’t know how they did it)
  * Landing page -- https://www.housingstudies.org/research-publications/publications/composition-cook-countys-housing-market/  
* Opportunity Zones:
  * Enterprise Community
  * https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/opportunity360/opportunity-zone-eligibility-tool
* Policy Map (has opportunity areas among other things, came out of MHL)

##Gentrification:
* Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University
  * Includes property sales data, mortgage data, foreclosure filings data and vacancy data
  * Background + data -- https://www.housingstudies.org/page/ihs-data-projects/
* Partnership Organizations:
  * NowPow list of Chicago Service Providers

#Scope:
##Questions:
* What medium will convey this information best?
* Who is the target audience? What is the best case scenario for this?
* What geographic region will be most useful. Is it just Cook County, or also DuPage and Lake?
#Preliminary Findings / Guesses
##OZ/2- to 4- flat overlap:
* Neighborhoods containing OZs with the highest proportion of 2- to 4- flat housing
  * West: Humboldt Park (57%), West Garfield (65%), North Lawndale (57%)
  * South: Fuller Park (66%), New City (70%), Englewood/West Englewood (~50% but almost totally covered by OZ tracts)  

#Description of data types included in the tool:
* Opportunity Zones: Originally introduced in the Investing in Opportunity Act (IIOA), the Opportunity Zones Program was enacted as part of the 2017 tax reform package (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). The program is designed to drive long-term capital to rural and low-income urban communities throughout the nation, and uses tax incentives to encourage private investment in impact funds.
* Opportunity Areas (OAs): As defined by IHDA, are communities with low poverty, high access to jobs and low concentrations of existing affordable rental housing. OAs are identified annually and retain the designation for at least four years as long as they continue to meet the identification criteria. Locating your project in an OA is a scoring factor in the 2018-2019 QAP. Scattered site projects with at least one site in an OA will receive a pro-rata score based on the proportion of total units located in the OA. Fractional scores will be rounded up to the next whole number.
* Affordable Market Share: The Affordable Market Share is calculated by dividing the total number of rental units financed by IHDA, HUD, and USDA by the estimated number of rental units for that community. If the Affordable Market Share for a place or census tract is above 20%, the Place or Tract does not qualify as an Opportunity Area. IHDA uses a similar Affordable Market Share metric in its Preliminary Project Assessment review of applications. For the PPA, Affordable Market Share is determined on a case-by-case basis and units funded by multiple resources can be backed out to avoid double counting. For this determination, such individualization is impossible and therefore the Affordable Market Share utilized in the Opportunity Area determination may include duplication. Qualifying geographies that are over the thresholds for either of the Concentration Metrics utilized are not considered Opportunity Areas even if they qualify under all the other determination metrics. Data is not shown for places with population under 1,000.
* HUD Qualified Census Tract: A Qualified Census Tract (QCT) is any census tract (or equivalent geographic area defined by the Census Bureau) in which at least 50% of households have an income less than 60% of the Area Median Gross Income (AMGI). HUD has defined 60% of AMGI as 120% of HUD's Very Low Income Limits (VLILs), which are based on 50% of area median family income, adjusted for high cost and low income areas.
* Mean travel time to work: Mean travel time to work is an indication of how long it takes people to get to their jobs. Unlike other indicators of transportation / job access this metric does not presume a need to access public transportation or multiple nodes of travel – though this metric doesn’t discount this type of access either. Eligible geographies must be above or below (as appropriate) a threshold benchmark in ALL Major Determination Metric categories to qualify as Opportunity Areas. Data is not shown for places with population under 1,000.
* IHA Member Hospitals: A pretty good indication of where all the hospitals in IL are. The IHA (Illinois Health and Hospital Association) has member hospitals all over the state.
* USDA Food Desserts: As defined by the USDA, a low access tract at 1 mile for urban areas and 10 miles for rural areas. This does NOT completely align with IHDA guidelines for Opportunity Area scoring, since the city of Chicago has a stricter 0.5 mile radius for what should be considered a food dessert. This will help rule out places that clearly do not fall under IHDA guidelines and is accurate for everywhere except the city of Chicago.
